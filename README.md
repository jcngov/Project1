#Speed Memory

#Intro

Speed Memory is a fun game for all ages, testing concentration skills and speed. In the original memory game, all tiles are faced down and two tiles are flipped face up over each turn.  The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards until every tile is matched. Speed Memory applies the same objective but adds a new twist by adding a little pressure to the player by testing how fast they could match each pair.

#How to Play

1. Player goes first by clicking "Player 1 Button".
2. Player clicks on a tile of their choosing, followed by another tile.
3. When clicked, an image appears on the corresponding tile.
4. If the tile images match, they will stay visibile.
5. If not, the tiles will turn back to white.
6. Time stops after every image is shown.
7. After Player 1 finishes, Player 2 is triggered by clicking on "Player 2 Button".
8. After Player 2 finishes, the winner will be declared by who finished the fastest.
