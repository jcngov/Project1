#Speed Memory

#Intro

Speed Memory is a fun game for all ages, testing concentration skills and speed. In the original memory game, all tiles are faced down and two tiles are flipped face up over each turn.  The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards until every tile is matched. Speed Memory applies the same objective but adds a new twist by adding a little pressure to the player by testing how fast they could match each pair.
